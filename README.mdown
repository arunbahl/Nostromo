I like the look of BezelHUD, but I’ve never felt like the square interfaces worked well for longer names/strings (which I run into frequently). Primer works well for this, but it doesn’t look as nice. I also feel like a lot of the interfaces were designed when 1440x900 was considered large.

Here some examples of what some things might look like:

http://projects.skurfer.com/PrimerHUD/?x=downloads  
http://projects.skurfer.com/PrimerHUD/?x=url  
http://projects.skurfer.com/PrimerHUD/?x=search  
http://projects.skurfer.com/PrimerHUD/?x=host

(The working title was PrimerHUD.)

You can mouse over one of the panes to see what it might look like highlighted.

This interface requires Quicksilver ß61 or higher.
